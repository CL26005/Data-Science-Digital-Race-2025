# 🏆 Data Science Digital Race (DSDR) 2025 


A comprehensive **Python-based Data Science and Machine Learning project** developed for **Data Science Digital Race (DSDR) 2025** organized by the **Universiti Malaya Data Analytics Club (UMDAC)**.
Created by **Group 0+c**.

---

## 📖 Overview
This repository showcases three competition rounds focusing on **data analytics**, **predictive modeling**, and **insight generation** across multiple domains.
Each round applies **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **machine learning** techniques to solve real-world problems through data-driven approaches.

---

## 🧮 Round 1 — Data Science Fundamentals (MCQ)
A **group-based conceptual round** testing participants on **data science**, **statistics**, and **machine learning fundamentals**.

---

## 🏦 Round 2 — Bank Customer Churn Prediction

A classification task designed to **predict customer churn** based on financial and demographic attributes.

**Highlights:**
- 🔍 Data preprocessing: Outlier capping, feature encoding, and SMOTE balancing
- ⚙️ Models trained: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- 📈 Best Model: **XGBoost** (≈86% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.835)
- 💡 Key Factors: Credit score, balance, and age significantly affect churn likelihood

**Conclusion:**
XGBoost effectively predicts churn, providing a valuable tool for customer retention strategies.
